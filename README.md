This is c++ compiler interface.

It compiles your .cpp file (using Mingw) and runs it.

How to set up:
1. install Mingw compiler and add it to your path
2. install python interpreter (recommended 3.7.9)
3. place main.py and dataa.txt in the same folder somewhere on your computer.
4. open dataa.txt and insert full path to your .cpp file in it. (example: D:\documents folder\test_file.cpp)
5. double click main.py to run it.

Note: main.py is by default configured to run .cpp files from D: drive only,
you can change it to other drive in main.py file, line 44.

.cpp file cannot contain spaces in it's name, but it can contain non-english letters.
Folders in which are .cpp file can contain spaces in their names, but cannot contain non-english letters.

Before running main.py you need to save your .cpp file (convenient to use ctrl + s).
